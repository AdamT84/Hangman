## Testing

### Testing user stories. 


#### First Time Player. 


1. As a new player, I want to be able to easily understand the game purpose and find instructions about it.
    - The start screen tells the user the name of the game and that it is a game of chance.
    - There is a rules button allowing the user to view the easy to follow rules diagram.
    - On the main game screen the user is told how to start the game.

2. As a new player, I want to be able to take my time and not be rushed.
    - There is no timing function used, the player decides the speed of the game.

3. As a new player, I want to know easily if I have won or lost the round.
    - The result of each round is displayed clearly in the results area. 
    - After the player or the computer gets 10 wins the game ends and the user is clearly informed if they have won or lost.

4. As a new player, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile devices. 
    - The website has been designed with mobile devices in mind and fully tested to ensure all aspects of the site are responsive. 

#### Frequent Player Goals

1. As a frequent player I want to feel the game is random and I can both win and lose.
    - The game is truly random as the computer player is programmed to select a random choice each time. There are no patterns or preferences to pick a certain option.
    - The choice selected by both player and computer are displayed.

2. As a frequent player I want to ensure I can see my score and the computers score.
    - The scores for both player, computer and ties are tracked correctly throughout the game.

3. As a frequent player I want to start the game quickly without having to look at instructions or rules.
    - The player can click play on the start screen and begin play immediately without being prompted to look at the rules.


### Manual Testing
